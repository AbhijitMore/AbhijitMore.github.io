Driven by the conviction that data serves as a powerful tool for informed decision-making, I find inspiration in the vast realms of data and the computational prowess available to us. The synergy of extensive data and advanced computing empowers the creation of intelligent systems that not only complement human cognition but also surpass our inherent capabilities, mitigating errors in the process. My passion for data science and machine learning has fueled my engagement in diverse projects within academia and led me to a fulfilling internship as a Machine Learning Intern at HighRadius. Additionally, my role as an Associate Software Engineer - I at HighRadius involved implementing cutting-edge algorithms for product-driven research, further enriching my journey in the realm of technology and innovation.
